# Send SMS Through Google Sheets

## Overview
Do you store your customer’s information in an excel or Google Sheets spreadsheet? Wouldn’t it be handy to be able to send SMS to your customers directly from Google Sheets? With this guide we’ll show you how to integrate SignalWire API with Google Sheets API to track and contact customers regarding payments that are due. We’ll be using Google’s version of Javascript which is called Apps Script. You can modify this code however you need to fit your particular use case.
